## 2. JOB-SEARCH TARGETING (what to look for)

### 2.1 Target role titles (in rough priority order)
1. Machine Learning Research Engineer / ML Engineer (applied)
2. Applied Scientist / Applied Researcher / Research Scientist (industry)
3. Edge AI / Embedded ML / On-device ML Engineer
4. Audio ML / Music Technology / DSP Engineer (highest personal fit)
5. Computer Vision Engineer (industrial inspection, manufacturing, retail analytics)
6. Time-series / Signal-processing ML (IoT, sensor analytics, medical signals, ultrasound, wearables)
7. Solutions Architect / Tech Lead for real-time ML systems
8. Research Software Engineer / Scientific Computing (e.g., HPC centres)

### 2.2 Geography & work mode
- Base: Toronto, ON. Onsite Toronto ✔, hybrid ✔, remote-Canada ✔, relocation within Canada ✔ (Vancouver, Montreal, Ottawa, Waterloo all acceptable).
- Canada strongly preferred (PR status). Non-Canadian remote roles only if they hire Canadian residents.
- Montreal has a bonus signal: existing ties to McGill IDMIL/CIRMMT (Prof. Marcelo Wanderley).

### 2.3 Seniority
- PhD + 10 yrs total experience (≈5.5 yrs industry pre-PhD + 4 yrs PhD + 1 yr postdoc). Target: Senior / Staff-track IC, or Research Engineer II/III. Not targeting management-only roles, but has mentored engineers and set CI/CD & code-review practice at MAS.

### 2.4 Companies / sectors already identified as strong fits (from prior sweeps)
- Oncoustics (ultrasound signal ML — audio→ultrasound domain-transfer pitch; cold outreach drafted)
- eBay Toronto — Applied Researcher 2, Search Ranking & Monetization (hiring-manager interview completed)
- SciNet / University of Toronto HPC — two in-person interviews completed; decision pending as of late Aug 2026
- Waabi, Qualcomm Canada, RBC Borealis AI, Music.AI
- Natural fits by sector: audio/music tech (Ableton, Native Instruments, iZotope, Spotify, Moises/Music.AI, Splice, Landr [Montreal], Audioshake, Sonos), edge/embedded AI (Qualcomm, NXP, Synaptics, Ambarella, Hailo, Edge Impulse, Untether AI [Toronto], Tenstorrent [Toronto]), industrial CV/IoT (Cognex, Landing AI, Instrumental, Kinaxis, manufacturing automation), medical signal ML (Oncoustics, wearables, ultrasound), AR/VR/metaverse audio (Meta Reality Labs, Unity), fintech anomaly detection (RBC, TD, Scotiabank AI labs, Borealis).

### 2.5 Deal-breakers / low-fit signals
- Roles requiring US work authorization only.
- Pure LLM-prompting / chatbot-integration roles with no signal/ML-systems depth (he can do them but they under-use him; fit score should be moderate, not high).
- Roles requiring 5+ yrs of large-scale distributed training / LLM pre-training — not his track record (be honest: LLM/RAG experience is applied/tool-level, not research-level).

## 4. PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE (complete, reverse-chronological)

### 4.1 Postdoctoral Researcher — University of Trento, Italy · Jan 2025 – Dec 2025 [self; CIMIL page confirms role]
Project: **MUSMET — "Musical Metaverse made in Europe: an innovation lab for musicians and audiences of the future"**, EU Horizon EIC Pathfinder Open, grant 101184379, €3.0 M, Feb 2025 – Jan 2029, coordinated by University of Trento with 12 partners incl. KTH, Politecnico di Torino, g.tec, Somnium Space [verified via CORDIS].
- Owned the full ML pipeline for streaming audio + IMU/gesture data: acquisition → DSP/feature engineering → training/eval → edge deployment (Raspberry Pi 4, Elk Audio OS, VST plugin, OSC output) → monitoring.
- Real-time inference services at <30 ms latency on edge-class devices. Published system: 14 ms / F1 0.76 on RPi4 vs DTW 1038 ms / F1 0.65 [verified, JAES 2026]. (Older CVs say ">90% F1" — retired; use 0.76.)
- Designed benchmark suites (baselines + ablations: RNN vs DTW; audio vs MIDI; pattern-set sizes 1/3/10) to quantify accuracy–latency–CPU trade-offs.
- Built the "Smart Drums" study: DTW vs stacked RNN (LSTM-256 → GRU-128 → SimpleRNN-256) on MIDI and MFCC audio; RNN 15.8 ms (MIDI) / 21.4 ms (audio) vs DTW 366 / 1132 ms [self; JAES paper in press].
- Built **MIRaaS** (Music Information Retrieval as a Service): offloads MIR computation from edge devices to a server over UDP; latency characterization paper accepted at IEEE IS² 2026 [verified via CIMIL].
- Co-designed and ran two live multisensory concerts (stage lights, smoke, 10× Meta Quest 3 MR headsets, haptic smartphones) with 20 audience + 6 performer participants; built the **Hot Licks Mapper** routing tool.
- Built a **real-time multimodal data extraction & synchronization pipeline** for musical-metaverse experiments: music/audio + BCI (EEG) signals + head- and hand-tracking from mixed-reality headsets, captured live and time-synchronized across **4 musicians simultaneously** (4 × the full set of per-device streams). Done in partnership with **SAE Institute Barcelona** and **g.tec medical engineering** (MUSMET consortium partner). [self] → strong evidence for multi-sensor time-series alignment, neurotech/BCI data engineering, and XR telemetry work.
- Researched **pattern recognition as a teaching tool** (real-time detection accuracy as practice feedback — e.g., green/red light when a phrase is played correctly) and **as an assistive aid for disabled musicians** (pattern-triggered control replacing manual controllers). [self] → relevant to music-education, accessibility and assistive-tech roles.
- 4 peer-reviewed outputs in 2025 (2× I3DA, 1× IS², JAES accepted) + PhD thesis; demos at Notte della Ricerca (MUSE Trento) and the MUSMET kickoff.
- Coordinated with academic + industry partners; wrote deployment docs and reproducible pipelines.
- Dates confirmed by Nishal: 1 Jan 2025 – 31 Dec 2025. (Website still shows "Research Assistant, Mar 2025 – present" — needs updating.)

| DoPP | Dataset of Polyphonic Patterns | WAV audio, 44.1 kHz / 24-bit (confirmed; datasets.html wrongly says 48 kHz/16-bit), polyphonic | 2,276 files, 20 performers, 176 patterns, mean 5.2 s; 89.3% variation pairs chroma-sim > 0.9 | 20 musicians (10 keys, 10 guitar; age 26–55), 10 patterns × 10 takes = 2,000; RME Fireface UFX / Zoom U-24; mean 7.4–8.4 s | 10.5281/zenodo.14497998 | verified DOI |

| DoDP2 | Dataset of Drum Patterns v2 | MIDI, GM drums, uniform 96 tpb | 2,177 files, 10 performers, 100 patterns, mean 21.8 versions; 194 artist-template files (patternID −1) for style anchors / zero-shot | 20 drummers total across DoDP+DoDP2 used in Smart Drums paper (2,000 instances, MIDI + 48 kHz/24-bit audio) | 10.5281/zenodo.18395007 | verified DOI |

Shared design: `artistID_patternID_versionID` naming, unified artist-ID namespace, live musicians, expressive variation with "perceptual equivalence" as the only constraint → worst-case benchmark for live pattern detection; also positioned for expressive-variation modelling, groove analysis, style transfer and music generation.

**Citation rule (confirmed by Nishal): agents cite the Zenodo file counts** — DoMP 4,392 · DoPP 2,276 · DoDP 994 · DoDP2 2,177 = **9,839 files from 80 performer-slots (40 + 20 + 10 + 10; "70+ musicians" is the safe phrasing)**. Use the paper round numbers only when quoting a specific paper's experiment.

## 15. FRAMING RULES FOR AGENTS

1. **Pick ONE variant from the matrix below and do not mix rows.** The variant fixes the tagline, section order, competency group names, the third Technical Stack line, publication count and page target. `cv-template.tex` carries the same matrix inline with per-section instructions; this table is the summary.

| # | Variant | When | Tagline | Distinctive structure | Pages |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| V1 | AI-Industry (**default**) | Applied/product ML at a company | Machine Learning Research Engineer \| Deep Learning, Time-Series, Pattern Detection \| Applied ML | Groups: ML Engineering / Domain Expertise / Research & Leadership. Stack leans Kubernetes, MLflow, REST, ONNX, SageMaker, LLM/RAG, recommender & ranking | 2 |
| V2 | AI-Research | Research scientist, applied scientist, national lab | Research Scientist \| Real-Time Multimodal ML, Benchmarks & Open Datasets | Full publications + datasets + peer review + talks + supervision; drop Portfolio; ML/AI line leads with JAX, HuggingFace, PyTorch | 3 |
| V3 | Edge/Embedded | On-device ML, TinyML, real-time systems, silicon | ML Research Engineer \| Real-Time & Edge Inference \| Audio, Sensor & Time-Series | Groups: ML Engineering / Edge & System Optimization / Research Engineering. Third stack line = Edge & Systems (RPi, Embedded Linux, JUCE, Elk, ARM profiling). Keeps Projects | 2–3 |
| V4 | Music-Tech | Audio ML, MIR, instruments, creative tools | Music Technology ML Research Engineer \| Audio, DSP & Real-Time Systems | **Portfolio & Demos moves up** to just after the summary; **Education moves down** near the end; 4 publications incl. the PhD thesis; keep the guitarist line; Trinity Grade 8 may join Education | 2 |
| V5 | CV/Industrial | Inspection, manufacturing, robotics, retail | Computer Vision & ML Engineer \| Industrial Inspection, IoT & Edge Deployment | **Inverts the bullet weighting**: MAS gets 4–5 bullets, postdoc drops to 2. Third stack line = Computer Vision. Projects drawn from §8.2 | 2 |
| V6 | Generic | Speculative applications, recruiters, vague JDs | Research Engineer \| Real-Time ML, DSP & Time-Series \| Music Technology | Competencies as **one flat comma list, no group headings**; Education sits *before* the stack | 2 |
2. Always state PR status + no sponsorship near the top for Canadian roles.
3. Quantify with the verified numbers first (14 ms, 74×, F1 0.76/0.78, 95%, 98%), then the self-reported industrial numbers (300%, 99.5%, 50%). Never use ">90% F1".
4. For LLM-heavy JDs, position honestly: strong ML-systems engineer who uses LLM tooling daily (AI-assisted workflows, RAG-level integration) — not an LLM researcher.
5. For fintech/anomaly JDs, foreground Forestpin + MAS IoT analytics; for healthcare/medical-signal/neurotech JDs, foreground COVID vitals, the BCI + XR synchronization pipeline (g.tec), and the audio→ultrasound domain-transfer narrative (used for Oncoustics). For product/manufacturing-tech JDs, lead with Promptly as the commercial-impact story. For ed-tech, music-education or accessibility JDs, use the teaching-tool / disabled-musician research thread.
6. Languages on materials: English (native) always; Sinhala when a JD values South-Asian market/language coverage; Italian (B1) for Italian/EU-linked companies; French (~A2) only as "basic / actively learning" — never claim bilingual for Quebec or federal postings. For Montreal roles, mention the McGill IDMIL/CIRMMT connection; for Toronto HPC/scientific-computing roles, mention SciNet interviews are already in progress (avoid duplicate applications).
7. Employment gap since Jan 2026: cover with "Independent Research & Open-Source (Jan 2026 – present): Nebula (C++17 audio-feature library), LiveLaTeX (VS Code extension on the Marketplace), MIRaaS paper (IS² 2026), Smart Drums paper (JAES, in press), relocation to Canada."
8. **The variant sets the length; the JD can override it.** V1/V4/V5/V6 = 2 pages, V2 = 3, V3 = 2 unless the JD asks for publications.Extend to 3 pages only when the role rewards a full academic record (research scientist, postdoc, faculty, national lab, or any posting that asks for a publication list, teaching record, or evidence of supervision). At 3 pages add: the full publication list (§6, including theses and in-press items), the full Datasets section (§7), Scientific Committee & Peer Review (§10), Talks & Demos (§9), and Student Supervision (§4.1a). At 2 pages cut those, fold the datasets into a single Highlights line, and keep 3 bullets per role. Never exceed 3 pages; if it overflows, cut Talks before Publications. `cv-template.tex` tags every section [CORE] or [EXTENDED] accordingly.
9. Writing style Nishal wants in generated materials: concise, technically precise, no fluff, copy-paste-ready, stay within the original CV's scope and length, attach a changelog to revisions.
